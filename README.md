## RU CS520 Projects :clipboard:
Hello there!\
This repository holds my programming projects done during the period of Rutgers University CS520 course â€“ Introduction to AI.


### :pushpin: Project Objectives and Execution:

* Ghosts in the Maze 

  It helps the agent walk out of a maze full of ghosts by simulating different strategies.
To see the results,
    1. Clone this repository (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `git clone https://github.com/CharleneChar/RUCS520Projects.git`
    2. Execute the main.py under 1_ghosts_in_the_maze directory (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `python3 1_ghosts_in_the_maze/main.py`

* The Circle of Life

  It helps the agent capture the prey and avoid being caught by the predator under different constraints by simulating different strategies.
To see the results,
    1. Clone this repository (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `git clone https://github.com/CharleneChar/RUCS520Projects.git`
    2. Execute the main.py under 2_the_circle_of_life directory (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `python3 2_the_circle_of_life/main.py`

* Better, Smarter, Faster

  It has the same objective as that in The Circle of Life (which helps the agent capture the prey and avoid being caught by the predator under different constraints) but uses trained models from machine learning to achieve.
To see the results,
    1. Clone this repository (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `git clone https://github.com/CharleneChar/RUCS520Projects.git`
    2. Execute the main.py under 3_better_smarter_faster directory (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `python3 3_better_smarter_faster/main.py`
