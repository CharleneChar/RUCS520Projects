## RU CS520 Projects :clipboard:
Hello there!\
This repository holds my programming projects done during the period of Rutgers University CS520 course â€“ Introduction to AI.


### :pushpin: Project Objectives and Execution:

* Ghosts in the Maze 

  It helps the agent find path to walk out of a specified-sized maze full of a specified number of ghosts by simulating and analyzing different strategies which implement search algorithms including A^* search algorithm.
  
  To see the process and result,
    1. Clone this repository (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `git clone https://github.com/CharleneChar/RUCS520Projects.git`
    2. Execute the main.py under 1_ghosts_in_the_maze directory (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `python3 1_ghosts_in_the_maze/main.py`

* The Circle of Life

  It helps the agent find path to capture the prey and avoid being caught by the predator under different constraints (such as the predator's location or the prey's location is unknown to the agent) by simulating and analyzing different strategies which implement filtering and predicting with a Markov model where both transition model and observed model are known.
  
  To see the process and result,
    1. Clone this repository (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `git clone https://github.com/CharleneChar/RUCS520Projects.git`
    2. Execute the main.py under 2_the_circle_of_life directory (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `python3 2_the_circle_of_life/main.py`

* Better, Smarter, Faster

  It has the same objective as that in The Circle of Life (which helps the agent find path to capture the prey and avoid being caught by the predator under different constraints) except that the path needs to be the shortest. The project not only implements value iteration for Bellman's Equations, but also trains models including linear regression model and neural network model to achieve the above objective.

  To see the process and result,
    1. Clone this repository (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `git clone https://github.com/CharleneChar/RUCS520Projects.git`
    2. Execute the main.py under 3_better_smarter_faster directory (PS you may follow the command below) \
  `python3 3_better_smarter_faster/main.py`
